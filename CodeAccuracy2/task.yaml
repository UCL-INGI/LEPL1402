    In order to discover the importance of pre/post conditions and invariants in your programs, we will take the example of QuickSort.

    Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer method for sorting. It works by partitioning an array into two parts, then sorting the parts independently. It takes the first element of the Array, then it determines its position in the array by iterating through it. If an element is lower, it moves the element to its left and increment its own position. Then it recursivly do the same operation for each sub array (left and right of the pivot).

    The crux of the method is the partitioning process , which can be summarized as follows :

       :align: center
       :figclass: align-center

    Even with this simple algorithm, mistakes can occur and that is why we ask you to complete the implementation
    contained in this file_ , without forgetting to add assert statements in each method (as they will be tested separately in INGINIOUS).
