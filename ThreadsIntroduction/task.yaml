    In this task, we will ask you to implement the ``init`` method of this Launcher_ class :


    .. code-block:: java

        public class Launcher {

            /*
             * Instantiate and start each thread from "t" with its OWN Counter object,
             * then wait for all threads to finish and return the set of Counter objects
             * the threads ran on. Each thread must be named according to its index in the
             * "t" array.
             */
            public static Counter[] init(Thread [] t) {
                // YOUR CODE HERE
            }

        }


    In Java, a thread needs an entry point to know where to start when we want it to run : this entry point can be
    any object implementing the Runnable_ interface. For this exercise, we give you a small implementation of the Runnable_ interface : Counter_, a small class increasing
    an int variable ``rnd`` times.

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains few tests to help you.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Counter implements Runnable {

            private int count;
            private int rnd;

            public int getCount() {
                return count;
            }

            public int getRnd(){
                return rnd;
            }

            public Counter(){
                this.count = 0;
                this.rnd = (int) ( (Math.random()*100) + 1000);
            }

            @Override
            public void run() {
                for(int i=0; i< getRnd(); i++){
                    count += 1;
                }
            }

        }
