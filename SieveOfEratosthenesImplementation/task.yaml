    In this task you are asked to implement the method ``numberOfPrime(int n)`` that returns the number of prime numbers between :math:`0` and :math:`n` using the `Eratosthene algorithm`_. To implement this we force you to use a BitSet_, you are not allowed to use an array: you must work with the ``bits`` variable.

    The goal of this exercise is to introduce you to the `java documentation`_ and to make sure that you are able to read, understand and use class that are defined and documented in java.

    .. code-block:: java

        public static BitSet bits; //You should work on this BitSet

        public static int numberOfPrime(int n){
            //TODO By Student
        }
