    Given the Student_ class, You are asked to write the implementation of the StudentFunctions_ class ( that implements the StudentStreamFunction_ interface ) :

    .. code-block:: java

       import java.util.stream.Stream;

       public interface StudentStreamFunction {

          // Find the N°2 and N°3 top students for the given course name in parameter
          public Stream<Student> findSecondAndThirdTopStudentForGivenCourse(
              Stream<Student> studentStream, String name);

          // Compute for each student in the given section their average grade result,
          // sorted by their result (ascending) as an array of array structured like that :
          // [ ["Student FirstName1 LastName1", 7.5], ["Student FirstName2 LastName2", 9.5] ]
          public Object[] computeAverageForStudentInSection(Stream<Student> studentStream,
                                                              int section);

          // Give the number of students that success in all courses (> 10.0)
          public int getNumberOfSuccessfulStudents(Stream<Student> studentStream);

          // Find the student that is the last one in the lexicographic order
          // ( You must first compare students on their lastNames then on their firstNames )
          public Student findLastInLexicographicOrder(Stream<Student> studentStream);


          // Give the full sum of the grade obtained by all students
          public double getFullSum(Stream<Student> studentStream);

       }


    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains few tests to help you.
