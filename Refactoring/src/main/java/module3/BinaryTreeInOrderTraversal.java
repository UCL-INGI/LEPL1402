/**
 * In this task, we ask you to implement two different version of an "in-order" tree traversal :
 * a recursive version and an iterative version.
 * Both function will take a Node representing the root of the tree itself and a List<Integer>
 * that you have to fill with the tree nodes' val respecting the "in-order" traversal.
 *
 * Example: the following tree, when explored in an in-order fashion, will give A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I.
 * This type of tree traversal is thus very useful to retrieve all nodes from a tree as an ordered list,
 * provided that the tree itself is "sorted", i.e, for each node, its left subtree only contain "smaller" nodes and its right
 * subtree only contain "greater" nodes (which is the case in the example, considering the alphabetical order).
