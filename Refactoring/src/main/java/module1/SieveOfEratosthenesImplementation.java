/**
 * In this task you are asked to implement the method numberOfPrime(int n) that returns the number of prime numbers between 0 and n using the `Eratosthene algorithm`.
 * To implement this we force you to use a BitSet, you are not allowed to use an array: you must work with the bits variable.
 *
 * The goal of this exercise is to introduce you to the `java documentation` and to make sure that you are able to read,
 * understand and use class that are defined and documented in java.
 *

 *
 *         public static int numberOfPrime(int n){
 *             //TODO By Student
 *         }
