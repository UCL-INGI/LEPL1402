/**
 * Although it will seem a bit weird, we will ask you to write code generating Exception. But why?
 * The reason is simple, when you start programming in a new language it sometimes is really hard to understand why your code won't run properly.
 * We made this exercise to help you understand what your mistake can be.
 *
 * Before starting this exercise we recommend you to read about NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and ConcurrentModificationException.
 *
 * -    ConcurrentModificationException: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html
 * -    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.html
 * -    NullPointerException: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html
