    In this task, we will ask you to implement a basic calculator (+,-,*,/) using the visitor design pattern.
    Every expression you will compute will be represented as a tree.
    A tree contains at least one node and every node of the tree is either:

    - a parent node containing two sub nodes (an operand)

    - a leaf (a value)

    Here is an example of how your code is supposed to run:

    .. code-block:: java

        Node root = new Add(                                            // ((6-2)/(1+1))+(5*2)
                            new Div(                                    // (6-2)/(1+1)
                                new Sub(new Leaf(6), new Leaf(2)),      // 6-2
                                new Add(new Leaf(1), new Leaf(1))),     // 1+1
                            new Mult(new Leaf(5), new Leaf(2)));        // 5*2
        Visitor calculator = new Evaluation();

        calculator.visit((Add)root); // 12


    **We provide you with a set of class you have to complete** here_.

    There are a lot of classes but there's no need to panic, as this exercise shouldn't require more than 50ish lines of code from you.

    Do note that a certain special case will require you to throw an ``IllegalArgumentException``.

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains a few tests to help you.
