    In this task we will ask you to use monitors for a thread-shared counter. When threads are executed concurrently and they share some piece of memory, unexpected/wrong results
    are very likely to happen. For example, if you run four threads on the same counter, each thread incrementing ten thousands times the counter, you would of course expect that the
    final value of the counter will be fourty thousands when all four threads are done... But in practice, if there is no synchronization mechanism of any kind between threads, you will
    see that the final value will certainly be different from what we expect. Your job for this task is thus to implement a synchronization mechanism for a counter using only java's built-in
    monitors. We ask you to implement the three following methods:

        - void inc() : increment once the counter.
        - void dec() : decrement the counter **if and only if** its current value is positive. In fact, the counter we ask you to implement must **always** be positive. If a thread wants to decrement the counter but its value is 0, it has to wait.
        - int get() : returns the current value of the counter.

    Pay attention, you are not allowed to use ``Lock`` for this mission, only built-in monitors_. You might also face a deadlock_ problem.
