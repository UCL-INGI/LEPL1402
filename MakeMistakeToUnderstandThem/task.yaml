    Although it will seem a bit weird, we will ask you to write code generating Exception. But why?
    The reason is simple, when you start programming in a new language it sometimes is really hard to understand why your code won't run properly. We made this exercise to help you understand what your mistake can be.

    Before starting this exercise we recommend you to read about NullPointerException_, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException_ and ConcurrentModificationException_.

    .. _ConcurrentModificationException: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html
    .. _ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.html
    .. _NullPointerException: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html
