    To complete this task you must implement a mergesort for FList using only FList. Arrays, ArrayList, etc. are prohibited for this exercise.

    Here is the class FList_ you will be using. Try first to implement the FList by yourself in this exercise_ before starting this one.

    And here is the method you must implement: note that you have to implement merge recursivly and you are allowed to create other methods.

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains few tests to help you.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class FListMerge {


            /*
            * This method receives an FList and returns the FList containing the same values but sorted with the smallest value to the highest one.
            *
            */
            public static FList<Integer> mergeSort(FList<Integer> fList){
                //TODO By Student
            }

            //TO Complete if needed
        }
