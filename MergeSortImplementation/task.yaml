    In this exercise we ask you to implement the top-down_ merge sort  algorithm on an array of integer. You have to use **2 methods**:

        - Sort, this method has to divide the array and apply merge.
        - Merge, this method has to merge the array given the 2 index, it receives from sort 3 index, lower bound, middle and high. It also receives a copy of the first array.

    The tests are build to make you able to test the two methods separly but we **recommand** you to test them by yourself.

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains few tests to help you.

    .. _`IntelliJ Project`: /course/LEPL1402/MergeSortImplementation/LEPL1402_MergeSortImplementation.zip

    Here is the class MergeSort_:

    .. code-block:: java

        public class MergeSort {

            /**
             * Pre-conditions: a[lo..mid] and a[mid+1..hi] are sorted
             * Post-conditions: a[lo..hi] is sorted
             */
            private static void merge(int[] a, int[] aux, int lo, int mid, int hi) {
                // TODO By Student
            }
            /**
             * Rearranges the array in ascending order, using the natural order
             */
            public static void sort(int[] a) {
                // TODO By Student
            }

            //TODO Optionnal additionnal method
        }
