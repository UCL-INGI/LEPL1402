    In this task, we ask you to implement several common methods inspired from java's String_ API. The objective of this task is to get you used
    to String manipulation in java. In order to succeed this task, you will have to implement four different methods from a class we called ``StringUtils`` :

    - ``split(String str, char marker)`` : separate a String into fragments each time a specific character ``marker`` is encountered. Note that, for simplicity, marker is a ``char`` whereas in java's String_ it is a ``String``. For example, calling your method with "Here. I. Go." with marker '.' should return an array of size three with "Here", "I" and "Go" in its cells.
    - ``indexOf(String str, String sub)`` : returns the index of the first occurrence of the ``String`` sub in the ``String`` str. For example ``indexOf("Hello", "ell")`` should return 1, ``indexOf("Hello", "o")`` should return 4. If there is no occurrence of sub in str, return -1.
    - ``toLowerCase(String str)`` : returns a String with the same characters as 'str' except that all upper case characters have been replaced by their lower case equivalent.
    - ``palindrome(String str)`` : Returns true if the string 'str' is a palindrome : a string that reads the same from left to right AND from right to left (for example, "kayak"). Note that this method does not exist in java's String_ API because it's not very useful. But it is still a good exercise to train yourself to manipulate String objects in java.

    Here is the skeleton of the ``StringUtils`` (downloadable here_):

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains few tests to help you.
