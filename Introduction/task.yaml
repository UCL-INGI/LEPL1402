    Welcome to the first task of a long series!

    This serie of inginious tasks will accompany you throughout the quadrimester to learn java and apprehend the material seen in class. Successful completion of all tasks is a major step towards the success of this course. We encourage you to try to do them yourself without going on the Internet.

    We also encourage you to try your solutions by yourself on you computer. To do so take a look at `this tutorial`_ on the tools you will need.

    This first task will cover the basics of java step by step. In most exercises we want you to paste the **signature** and the **body** of the methods you create. In other cases we just wan to you paste the **body** and we give you the **signature**.

    Here is the class that you must implements in this task. The context of all variable must be static and the modifier public. You must find the return type by yourself.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class IntroductionExercises {

            public static int variable = 0;

            public static int[] squares;

            //TODO

        }

problems:
    student_attribute:
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``attribute(int
            value)`` that changes the value of the variable ``variable`` to ``value``.
        language: java
        default: ''
        name: Methods and variables
        type: code
    student_add:
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``add(int
            a, int b)`` that returns the addition of ``a`` and ``b``.
        name: Return
        type: code
        language: java
        default: ''
    student_equals:
        default: ''
        type: code
        language: java
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``equalsIntegers(int
            a, int b)`` that returns *true* if ``a`` is equal to ``b``.
        name: Comparison
    student_middleValue:
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``middleValue(int
            a, int b, int c)`` that returns the middle value between ``a``, ``b``
            and ``c``. So if :math:`a > b > c`, the method should return b. If minimum
            two value are equals, return **-1**.
        default: ''
        name: Conditions
        language: java
        type: code
    student_max:
        header: |-
            Paste here the **body** of the method ``max``. You can only use a ternary expression (no if/else structure are allowed).

            .. code-block:: java

                /*
                 * Function that returns the max between a and b
                 * You must use a ternary operation
                 */
                public static int max(int a, int b){
                    //TODO
                }
        name: Ternary expression
        type: code_single_line
        default: ''
    student_salutation:
        language: java
        header: |
            Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of the method ``greetings(String str)``.
            This method return :

                - "Good morning, sir!" if ``str`` is "Morning"
                - "Good evening, sir!" if ``str`` is "Evening"
                - "Hello, sir!" otherwise

            Your implementation should be case sensitive. **You should not use if/else if/else.**
        default: ''
        name: Switch ... case ...
        type: code
    student_lastFirstMiddle:
        default: ''
        header: |-
            Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``lastFirstMiddle(int[] a)``. This method returns a new array of three integers contained in this order :

                - The last element of ``a``
                - The first element of ``a``
                - The element of the middle of ``a`` (given :math:`l` the length of a, take the element of index :math:`\frac{l}{2}`)
        type: code
        language: java
        name: Arrays
    student_sum:
        name: For loop
        type: code
        language: java
        default: ''
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of the method ``sum(int[]
            array)`` that return the sum of all elements of ``array``. You should
            use a for loop, while loops being prohibited.
    student_maxArray:
        type: code
        name: While loop
        language: java
        default: ''
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of the method ``maxArray(int[]
            array)`` that returns the maximum element of ``array``. You should use
            a while loop, for loops being prohibited.
    student_main:
        type: code
        header: |-
            Paste here the **body** of the ``main`` method. The main method is the method that runs a program. When you start a program, you can pass a list of arguments to start you program. For example here, we can enter in a terminal ``javac IntroductionExercises.java`` to compile our program and then ``java IntroductionExercises 1 5 20``.

            Be careful with the type of the argument and don't hesitate to consult the java API_.

            .. code-block:: java

                /*
                 * Using the arguments paste to the program in args
                 * Bound the variable squares with the square of
                 * the elements passed in argument.
                 * Look at the java API : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html
                 * If an exception occurs, assign the value 0 at the index where it occurs
                 * -> use a try ... catch ...
                 */
