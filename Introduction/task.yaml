    Welcome to the first task of a long series!

    This serie of inginious tasks will accompany you throughout the quadrimester to learn java and apprehend the material seen in class. Successful completion of all tasks is a major step towards the success of this course. We encourage you to try to do them yourself without going on the Internet.

    We also encourage you to try your solutions by yourself on you computer. To do so take a look at `this tutorial`_ on the tools you will need.

    This first task will cover the basics of java step by step. In most exercises we want you to paste the **signature** and the **body** of the methods you create. In other cases we just wan to you paste the **body** and we give you the **signature**.

    Here is the class that you must implements in this task. The context of all variable must be static and the modifier public. You must find the return type by yourself.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class IntroductionExercises {

            public static int variable = 0;

            public static int[] squares;

            //TODO

        }

problems:
    student_attribute:
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``attribute(int
            value)`` that change the value of the variable ``variable`` to ``value``.
        language: java
        default: ''
        name: Methods and variables
        type: code
    student_add:
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``add(int
            a, int b)`` that return the addition of ``a`` and ``b``.
        language: java
        type: code
        name: Return
        default: ''
    student_equals:
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``equalsIntegers(int
            a, int b)`` that return *true* if ``a`` is equal to ``b``.
        language: java
        default: ''
        type: code
        name: Comparison
    student_middleValue:
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``middleValue(int
            a, int b, int c)`` that return the middle value between ``a``, ``b`` and
            ``c``. So if :math:`a > b > c`, the method should return b. If minimum
            two value are equals, return **-1**.
        default: ''
        language: java
        type: code
        name: Conditions
    student_max:
        default: ''
        name: Ternary expression
        type: code_single_line
        header: |-
            Paste here the **body** of the method ``max``. You can only use a ternary expression.

            .. code-block:: java

                /*
                 * Function that return the max between a and b
                 * You must use a ternary operation
                 */
                public static int max(int a, int b){
                    //TODO
                }
    student_salutation:
        header: |-
            Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of the method ``greetings(String str)``.
            This method return :

                - "Good morning, sir!" if ``str`` is "Morning"
                - "Good evening, sir!" if ``str`` is "Evening"
                - "Hello, sir!" otherwise

            Your implementation should be case sensitive.
        type: code
        language: java
        name: Switch ... case ...
        default: ''
    student_lastFirstMiddle:
        type: code
        language: java
        default: ''
        name: Arrays
        header: |-
            Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of a method ``lastFirstMiddle(int[] a)``. This method return a new array of three integers contained in this order :

                - The last element of ``a``
                - The first element of ``a``
                - The element of the middle of ``a`` (given :math:`l` the length of a, take the element of index :math:`\frac{l}{2}`)
    student_sum:
        default: ''
        type: code
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of the method ``sum(int[]
            array)`` that return the sum of all elements of ``array``. You should
            use a for loop.
        language: java
        name: For loop
    student_maxArray:
        default: ''
        name: While loop
        header: Paste here the **signature** and the **body** of the method ``maxArray(int[]
            array)`` that return the maximum element of ``array``. You should use
            a while loop.
        language: java
        type: code
    student_main:
        header: |-
            Paste here the **body** of the ``main`` method. The main method is the method that runs a program. When you start a program, you can pass a list of arguments to start you program. For example here, we can enter in a terminal ``javac IntroductionExercises.java`` to compile our program and then ``java IntroductionExercises 1 5 20``.

            Be careful with the type of the argument and don't hesitate to consult the java API_.

            .. code-block:: java

                /*
                 * Using the arguments paste to the program in args
                 * Bound the variable squares with the square of
                 * the elements passed in argument.
                 * Look at the java API : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html
                 * If an exception occurs, assign the value 0 at the index where it occurs
                 * -> use a try ... catch ...
                 */
