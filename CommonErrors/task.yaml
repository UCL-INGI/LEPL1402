                  i3 is equal to i4
                  s1 is equal to s2
            feedback: s1 is a String constant which is stored in memory inside the
                java String pool, s2 is a String object which is stored in the heap
                but not inside the pool. If you compare them with ==, you will always
                get a false result because you compare the references (one is pointing
                to the string pool and the other to the heap). But if you compare
                them with .equals(), it will compare the values.
