    The tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle, it consists of three rods and a number of disk of different size which can slide onto any rod. The game starts with all the disks in an ascending order forming a stack on the first rod. The objective of this puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod. We know, it sounds easy, but there are 3 simple rules that make the game harder than you think.

    Here they are :
        - You can only move one disk at a time.
        - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and moving it to another stack or on an empty rod.
        - No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

    To help you a little bit, here is an example of how you can solve the problem with a stack of size 3.

       :width: 684 px

    In this exercise, you are asked to solve this puzzle for any size of stack by implementing this method and this method only! We are using Stack_, to get the first element of a stack, use the method ``pop``, and to add an element use the method ``push``. The object Disk_ is here to make sure you will not solve the exercise by just creating another stack.

    Here is the class TowerOfHanoi_ you must implement, you can create disk by yourself to test your method but it will not compile on Inginious if you try to do it.

    **hint:** you can call ``towerOfHanoi`` inside itself
