    In this task we will ask you to solve the producer/consumer problem, represented here as a concurrent bounded FIFO queue. We will run simultaneously two different types of threads on your queue :

        - Consumers, consuming (= dequeuing) elements from the queue.
        - Producers, producing (= enqueuing) elements to the queue.

    Your queue needs to be thread-safe : it must be able to operate in a concurrent environment. It also means that threads must wait if necessary.
    A producer can't progress if there's no space left in the queue. A consumer can't take element from the queue if it is empty.
    For this exercise, you will need to implement ``enqueue`` and ``dequeue``, using all the instance variables that are in
    the LockQueue_ class below. We strongly suggest you to look at await_ and signal_ (or ``signalAll``) methods. You are not allowed to instantiate new locks or condition objects.


    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains few tests to help you.
