    For this exercise we want you to make a method able to decode a set of ASCII (decimal) codes into a String. Please, read carefully
    the signature and the comments above the method's signature below :

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains few tests to help you.


    .. _`IntelliJ Project`: /course/LEPL1402/ASCIIDecoder/LEPL1402_ASCIIDecoder.zip

    .. code-block:: java

            /*
            * Forbidden characters are passed as an array of int.
            * Each element of this array correspond to the decimal ASCII code
            * of a forbidden character OR null if there's no forbidden character
            * If you encounter one of these forbidden character
            * you must ignore it when you translate your sentence.
            *
            * the 2D array "sentences" contain a set of decimal ASCII code we want you
            * to translate. Each sub-element of this array is a different sentence.
            * Ex : if we pass this array : { {"42", "72", "88"}, {"98", "99", "111", "47", "55"} }
            * to your decode method, you should return : { "*HX", "bco/7" }
            *
            * You should NEVER return null or an array containing null
            */
            public static String [] decode(int[] forbidden, String[][] sentences){
                // YOUR CODE HERE
            }

    We also highly suggest you to have a look at the StringBuilder_ and ArrayList_ APIs. We strongly encourage
    you to use them for this exercise.

    .. _StringBuilder : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html
    .. _ArrayList : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html
